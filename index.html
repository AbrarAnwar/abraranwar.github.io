        I'm Abrar! I'm a senior in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/">University of Texas at Austin </a> (Class of 2021)
    </p>

	<p>
        At UT, I primarily conduct research with the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~larg/bwi_web/">Building-Wide Intelligence Project</a>. 
        Here, I gained experience in robotics, localization, navigation, and perception.
    </p>

    <p>
        These last two summers, I have been interning at <a href="https://www.sandia.gov/index.html">Sandia National Laboratories</a>,
         where I have been working with the <a href="https://neuroscience.sandia.gov/research/NERL_Lab.html">Neural Exploration and Research Lab</a>. 
         I have worked on brain-inspired navigation and localization, and am currently working on evolving spiking circuit motifs. 
    </p>


    <p>Here are some papers, technical reports, and presentations I have done:
