I'm Abrar! I'm an senior in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin (Class of 2021)

At UT, I primarily conduct research with the [Building-Wide Intelligence Project](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~larg/bwi_web/). Here, I gained experience in robotics, localization, navigation, and perception.

These last two summers, I have been interning at [Sandia National Laboratories](https://www.sandia.gov/index.html), where I have been working with the [Neural Exploration and Research Lab (NERL)] (https://neuroscience.sandia.gov/research/NERL_Lab.html). I have worked on brain-inspired navigation and localization, and am currently working on evolving spiking circuit motifs.
